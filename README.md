# Academic Performance Analysis README

## Overview
This repository contains code and data for analyzing the academic performance of schools based on their types (Charter vs. District). The analysis focuses on metrics such as average math and reading scores, as well as the percentages of students passing math, reading, and overall passing rates.

## Contents
- `schools_complete.csv`: Dataset containing information about schools.
- `students_complete.csv`: Dataset containing information about students.
- `academic_performance_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open `academic_performance_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the code cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.

## Analysis Steps
1. Data Loading: The datasets `schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv` are loaded into Pandas DataFrames.
2. Data Cleaning: Any missing or inconsistent data is handled, ensuring the datasets are ready for analysis.
3. Metric Calculation: Metrics such as average math and reading scores, as well as passing percentages, are calculated for each school.
4. Grouping by School Type: The data is grouped by school type (Charter vs. District) to compare academic performance.
5. Visualization: Bar plots are created to visualize the differences in academic performance between Charter and District schools.
6. Summary: A summary of the analysis findings is provided, highlighting the disparities in academic performance based on school type.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals significant differences in academic performance between Charter and District schools. Charter schools consistently demonstrate higher average scores and passing rates compared to District schools. These findings offer valuable insights for educational stakeholders and policymakers aiming to enhance student achievement outcomes.
